Customization
Adding menu items and sections
To add or modify menu items and sections, simply edit the relevant data in the menuData.js file. Each menu item should have a title, description, price, and img property. Menu sections are represented as objects with a title and items property. The title should be a string and the items property should be an array of menu item objects.

Customizing animations
The animation-on-scroll library provides several animation classes that can be used to animate elements on the page as they come into view. To use these animations, simply add the relevant class to the element you want to animate. The animation-on-scroll library also provides options for customizing the duration and delay of animations. See the library documentation for more information.

Deployment
